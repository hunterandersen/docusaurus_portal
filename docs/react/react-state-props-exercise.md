## Objective

Your objective is to create squares of different colors appear on the screen. When a square is clicked, it should update to a random color. State and props should be used to achieve this functionality.

## Steps

### Getting Started

We'll be in the same react repository that you created during the **React Intro Exercise**.

### Exercise 1: Project Structure

1. Create a new folder within `src/` called `components/`
2. Change your `App.js` to `App.jsx`. This will enable more VSCode emmet abbreviations for the file.
3. Change the contents of your `App.jsx` to be a class with a render method that returns `<h1>Hello World</h1>`

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 2: Managing State

### Exercise 3: Rendering Lists

### Exercise 4: Controlled Inputs

### Exercise 5: Passing Props
