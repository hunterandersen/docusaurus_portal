## Objective

Your objective is to create a Films component that will fetch a list of films from the Studio Ghibli API, and display them to the screen as a rendered list.

## Steps

### Getting Started

We'll be in the same react repository that you created during the **React Intro Exercise**.

### Exercise 1: Films Component

We'll start by creating a new class component.

1. Create a new file called `filmsList.jsx` in your `components/` folder
2. Import and destructure the `Component` from the `react` package
3. Add a class called `FilmsList` that renders an empty unordered list
4. You should have:

```jsx
class Films {
  render() {
    return <ul></ul>;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 2: Films State



### Exercise 3: Fetch Films

### Exercise 4: Render Films List

### Exercise 5: Render Films Component
