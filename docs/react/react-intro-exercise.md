## Objective

Your objective is to create your first react application with the `create-react-app` tool, and investigate the starter files you are given.

> This project repository will be used for all of the upcoming react exercises

## Getting Started

This is part 1 of TrueCoders' React Exercise Series.

We will create a new react repository that you work in for the duration of the series.

## Steps

React Series Part 1 has multiple exercises.

- [Exercise 1: Create the Project](#exercise-1-create-the-project)
- [Exercise 2: Open Visual Studio Code](#exercise-2-open-visual-studio-code)
- [Exercise 3: Start the React Development Server](#exercise-3-start-the-react-development-server)
- [Exercise 4: Update the App](#exercise-4-update-the-app)

### Exercise 1: Create the Project

Create a react project with `create-react-app`

1. Navigate to your `repos/` folder (or other desired place where you keep your projects)
2. Create a new react project by running `npx create-react-app react-project` in your terminal

### Exercise 2: Open Visual Studio Code

Open the new react project in Visual Studio Code

1. Open the app in VSCode.
2. Take note of the templated file structure. Open some of the files to see what is there before you make any changes.

### Exercise 3: Start the React Development Server

Start the development server to see the rendered output

1. Start the `create-react-app` development server by running `npm start` in your terminal
2. View the rendered output in the browser
   - Running `npm start` should open your browser for you, but you can always access your development server by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

> Be sure to be at your `react-project/` folder in your terminal before running `npm start`

### Exercise 4: Update the App

Make changes!

1. Open the `src/App.js` file
2. Try to change the paragraph inner html from `Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.` to `React is so cool!`
   - Keep your eyes on the rendered output in the browser. It changes automatically!
3. Add the following elements to the content in the `App.js` file. No specific order or structure required. Just see the elements updated on the DOM with the development server running.
   - a heading 1 element
   - another paragraph element
   - an unordered list with 3 list items

We're going to be spending a lot of time in React, but for now, you've created a new React project with the `create-react-app` tool, investigated the template source code, started the React development server, and made some initial changes!
