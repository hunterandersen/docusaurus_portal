## Objective

Your objective is to create your first react application with the `create-react-app` tool, and investigate the starter files you are given.

## Steps

1. Type `mkdir react-repos` if you haven’t already in Command Line, Terminal, or Git Bash.
2. cd into your new react-repos folder
3. Run `npx create-react-app react-intro` in your Terminal
4. Open the app in VSCode. If you want to do this from the Terminal or Command Line, you’ll first have to hit ctrl + c to terminate the dev environment that React is running.
5. In the `App.js` add a header element before the img element, that has the text “This is my first React App!”
6. Below the image, replace the contents of the P element with your first impression of React.
7. Lastly, reload the site!
