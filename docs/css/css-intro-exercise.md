## Objective

Your objective is to style your html portfolio with an external css stylesheet.

## Steps

1. Open your portfolio in VS Code.
2. Open your git bash if you’re on windows, or the terminal if you’re on Mac, and `cd` into your `repos` folder.
3. Once inside of your `repos` folder, `cd` into your portfolio project folder.
4. Once inside of your `portfolio` folder, `code .` to open VS Code at your current location in the terminal or git bash.
5. Create a new file named `styles.css`.
6. Add a `<link>` tag to the `<head>` of your HTML file, and add `href="styles.css"` as an attribute.

```html
<head>
  <link href="styles.css" />
</head>
```

- Have fun. Try to style the page using a least one tag selector, class selector, and id selector.
- Think about what you want your portfolio to look like, and ask or attempt to recreate the design.
