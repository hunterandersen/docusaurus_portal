## What is the Internet?

The internet is a computer network that is now based on the TCP/IP protocols to connect users with computer devices to one another.

The internet became very popular due to its _decentralized_ nature. This means that many different entities operate their own networks and traffic that are interconnected.

The _Internet Engineering Task Force_, IETF, is responsible for updating the technical standards for the internet, and the _Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers_, ICANN, is responsible for governing domain names and IP addresses (although they do not control the information sent across networks).

## IP Addresses

The _Internet Protocol_ assigns numbers to each device as identification to one another. For IPv4, IP addresses are made up of 4 numbers, ex: `1.2.3.4`, and there is the max capacity of ~4 billion different IP addresses with IPv4.

Today, we've needed more than ~4 billion different IP addresses, so IPv6 is growing in usage. IPv6 addresses are made up of 8 segments that are hexadectets (ex: `1b2f`), representing a total 128 bits (whereas IPv4 represented a total 32 bits).

## Wireless Internet and the Cloud

Internet isn't just accessed through physical wires. _WiFi_ and _Cellular_ networks provide _wireless_ internet for users.

Wifi is accessed through unlicensed spectrum, electromagnetic frequencies, while cellular is accessed through cell service territories, using licensed spectrum that is auctioned to cellular providers.

_Cloud computing_ refers to computer experiences enabled through internet services (Microsoft Word vs. Google Docs, etc). This lets the user have a more seamless and convenient experience with technology by allowing _the cloud_ (accessed with internet) to handle technical details (file syncs, software updates, etc).

## How information is transferred

Data is transmitted across the web through _packets_. Packets contain _headers_ and _data_. A single packet can hold up to 64 KB of data (20 pages of plain text).

Packet headers contain information about destination, length, and checksum for missing data in transit.

## Web History

The "Web" was created by _Tim Berners Lee_ in 1991, and supported hyperlinks for browsers web pages with a single click.

Berners-Lee created the _World Wide Web Consortium_, W3C, to standardize the web.

Speaking of the web, users use _web browsers_ to view web pages.

_Netscape_, formerly _Mosaic_, was the first successfuly web browser released in 1994.

Then came the giants: Microsoft's _Internet Explorer_, Netscapes' _Firefox_, Apple's _Safari_, and Google's _Chrome_.

> NOTE: Although W3C manages the standards of the web, no one is required to follow those standards (even though most major browsers do). The real determinators are the companies that create the browsers.

## SSL

_Secure Sockets Layer_, SSL, is how web connections are securely maintained. Any messages that you send or receive from a https server is encrypted so that no 3rd party listeners can understand/steal your data.

## Domain Names

The _Domain Name System_, DNS, is administered by ICANN, and consists of _general top level domains_, gTLD, and _country code top level domains_, ccTLD\_. Domain names give users the ability to browse the web by named addresses rather than their true IP addresses.
