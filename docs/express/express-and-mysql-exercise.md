## Objective

Your objective is to create routes for CRUD operations on our bestbuy database for **_products_**.

## Steps

- [Exercise 1: Routes for Products](#exercise-1-routes-for-products)

### Exercise 1: Routes for Products

We walked through connecting a mysql database to our express application, but we only created controllers and routes for employees. We'll leave this one exercise to instruct you on how to complete this exercise. There are several steps, but if you get stuck, you can reference our work with the employees data logic.

1. Create controllers, `findOne`, `findAll`, `addOne`, `updateOne`, and `removeOne`, for working with product data from the bestbuy database
2. Create routes, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, that will use these controllers and response with the appropriate data
3. Test your work
