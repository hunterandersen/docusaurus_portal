## Objective

Your objective is to write a function that takes in a number parameter and returns a function that adds the number parameter with a new number parameter.

## Getting Started

Exercise Repo: [JavaScript Higher-Order Functions](https://github.com/Bryantellius/JavaScript_HOF)

1. Open your command line and navigate to your repos directory (if you do not have a repos folder, then you can use mkdir repos to create one)
2. Use this template repository to start a new project in your repos folder: `git clone <repo_name>`
3. cd repo_name to navigate into your new repo directory
4. Start Visual Studio Code and select 'Open Folder'. Then select repo_name to open the folder in the editor (or just type code . in your terminal inside the repo directory)
5. Follow the instructions on the README.md file to complete exercises
6. Open the app.js file to get started

## Steps

1. Declare a function plus that takes in a number parameter.
2. Inside the body of plus, use the return keyword to return an anonymous function
3. The return function will take in a plusNumber parameter, and return the value of plusNumber with the first parameter number
4. Next, declare a variable plus15 that is assigned the value of plus with 15 passed in
5. console.log the result of plus15 with 10 passed in
   1. End result should resemble: console.log(plus15(10)) // Outputs 25
