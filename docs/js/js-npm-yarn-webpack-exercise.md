## Objective

Practice using the npm cli tool to initialize npm in our repository, and install open packages for use in our projects.

## Steps

1. Create a new project directory
2. Initialize npm in your new folder to create a `package.json` file
3. Install _five_ npm packages of your choice (can be `dayjs` like the video class walkthrough, or any other package of your choosing)
4. You should be able to see each package and it's version number in your `package.json` file under "dependencies:"
5. Create a `.gitignore` file, and have git ignore the newly created `node_modules` folder
6. Spend time on npm or researching articles to learn more about packages that you may want to use in future projects.

> NOTE: We will be using the installed packages in the next lesson
