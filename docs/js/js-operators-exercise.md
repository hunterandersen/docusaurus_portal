## Objective

Your objective is to practice using and reading operators and operation results between JavaScript values.

## Steps

### Exercise 1

1. Declare 2 variables, `a` and `b`, and assign `20` to `a` and `4` to `b`
2. Declare a variable `add` that uses the `+` operator to store the result of adding the values stored in `a` and `b`
3. Declare a variable `minus` that uses the `-` operator to store the result of subtracting the values stored in `a` and `b`
4. Declare a variable `multiply` that uses the `*` operator to store the result of multiplying the values stored in `a` and `b`
5. Declare a variable `dividing` that uses the `/` operator to store the result of dividing the values stored in `a` and `b`

You can print the value of the variables to the browser console (ex: `console.log(add)`) to check the result.

### Exercise 2

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```js
let a = 11;
let str = "11";
let str2 = "eleven";
let isPresent = true;
let firstName = "Jackie";
let lastName = "Chan";
```

- What is the value of: `a + str`?
- What is the value of: `a + str2`?
- What is the value of: `a + isPresent`?
- What is the value of: `a + firstName`?
- What is the value of: `a + lastName`?

Use the code above to test and print the results.

## Exercise 3

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```js
let d = 5;
let str3 = "5";
let str4 = "five";
let isPresent2 = false;
let firstName2 = "Robin";
let lastName2 = "Williams";
```

- What is the value of: `d == str3`?
- What is the value of: `d === str3`?
- What is the value of: `!isPresent2`?
- What is the value of: `("eleven" == str4 && d >= str3)`?
- What is the value of: `(!isPresent2 || isPresent2)`?
- What is the value of: `0 == false`?
- What is the value of: `0 === false`?
- What is the value of: `0 != false`?
- What is the value of `0 !== false`?

Use the code above to test and print the results.
