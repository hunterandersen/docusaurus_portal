## Objective

Your objective is to practice using and reading operators and operation results between JavaScript values.

## Steps

Exercise Repo: [JavaScript Operators](https://github.com/Bryantellius/JavaScript_Operators)

### Exercise 1

1. Declare 2 variables, `a` and `b`, and assign 20 to `a` and 4 to `b`
2. Declare a variable `add` that uses the `+` operator to store the result of adding the values stored in `a` and `b`
3. Declare a variable `minus` that uses the `-` operator to store the result of subtracting the values stored in `a` and `b`
4. Declare a variable `multiply` that uses the `*` operator to store the result of multiplying the values stored in `a` and `b`
5. Declare a variable `dividing` that uses the `/` operator to store the result of dividing the values stored in `a` and `b`

You can print the value of the variables to the browser console (ex: `console.log(add)`) to check the result.

### Exercise 2

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```
let num = 11;
let str = "11";
let str2 = "eleven";
let isPresent = true;
let firstName = "Frodo";
let lastName = "Baggins";
```

- What is the value of: num + str?
- What is the value of: num + str2?
- What is the value of: num + isPresent?
- What is the value of: firstName + num?
- What is the value of: isPresent + str?
- What is the value of: firstName + lastName?

Use the code above to test and print the results.

### Exercise 3

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```
let val = 5;
let str3 = "5";
let str4 = "five";
let isAwake = false;
```

- What is the value of: val == str3?
- What is the value of: val === str3?
- What is the value of: !isAwake?
- What is the value of: ("eleven" == str4 && val >= str3)?
- What is the value of: (!isAwake || isAwake)?
- What is the value of: 0 == false?
- What is the value of: 0 === false?
- What is the value of: 0 != false?
- What is the value of 0 !== false?

Use the code above to test and print the results.
