## Objective

Your objective is to practice JavaScript selection statements with number guessing validation logic. The user should be prompted to give a number guess, and receive feedback whether the number they guessed was the correct number or not.

## Steps

Clone the exercise repo: [JavaScript Selection Statements](https://github.com/truecodersio/JavaScript_Selection_Statements)

## Exercise 1

1. Initialize an integer to represent a favorite number and assign a value with a number of your choosing or you can assign a random number to this variable.
2. Use `window.prompt()` to ask the user to input a number, and store the result in a variable
3. Create an if-statement that if the guessed number is below the initial value, print out `"too low"`.
4. Create an else-if statement that if the number is higher than the initial value, print out `"too high"`.
5. Create an else statement that prints out `"Congratulations!!!"`.

> `window.prompt()` will use display a popup dialog box in the brower with a prompt (text displayed to the user based on the string you include in parentheses are prompt), and an input field where the user can give an answer (which you will receive as a string result from the method call).
> Ex: `let userAnswer = window.prompt("What is your favorite color?");`

## Exercise 2

1. Declare a variable named `userInput2` (or whatever topic you’ll ask about) and set the value to `window.prompt("Whatever question you want to ask here")`.
2. Inside of the parentheses, ask a question on whatever topic you’d like.
3. Create a switch-case statement with 5+ cases and a default case.
4. Log a response to the console depending on the value of `userInput2`.
