## Objective

Your objective is to practice running JavaScript files with the Node CLI.

## Getting Started

You will not be forking or cloning an exercise repo for this exercise. Rather, you will be running existing JavaScript files with the Node CLI, and creating a new file to create a simple server.

## Steps

- [Exercise 1: Run JavaScript Files in Node](#exercise-1-run-javascript-files-in-node)
- [Exercise 2: Create a Node Server](#exercise-2-create-a-node-server)

### Exercise 1: Run JavaScript Files in Node

1. Run existing JavaScript files on your computer
   - Keep in mind that we are not longer in the browser, so any file that references the `document` global object will throw an error

### Exercise 2: Create a Node Server

1. Create a file named `app.js`
2. Create a server, from the lecture code sample, and run the `app.js` file to start the server
3. Open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to test the response
