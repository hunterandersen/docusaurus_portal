`Hello World!`

We're glad you're here. The following docs will help you in your Web Development journey.

You can expect each lecture doc to have the following sections:

1. What
2. Why
3. How

Each lecture doc will be followed by an exercise (few may not provide an exercise).

We encourage you to create git repositories for each exercise, and commit them to GitHub. That way we can see your work, and you can build your portfolio along the way!

Reach out to any TrueCoders' Instructor or TA in Discord when you need assistance.

Happy Coding!
