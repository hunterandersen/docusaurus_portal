## Objective

Practice using HTML tags to structure a portfolio page with content about yourself.

## Steps

1. Create an html file in a new repo folder
2. Create a heading section with:
   - A heading containing your name
   - A picture of yourself
   - A brief description of yourself
3. Create a list with ways to contact you
4. Create a section about your work experience
5. Create a section about your education (i.e, TrueCoders, anything else relevant)
6. Create a section detailing anything extra
   - Add information you think is relevant here. For example (awards, certifications, recommendations)
7. Give the document a relevant title
